# Super fast raycasting with DDA algorithm
This project showcases a high-performance raycasting demonstration utilizing the DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm. Raycasting is a fundamental technique used in computer graphics, particularly in rendering 3D environments and creating immersive experiences.

The DDA algorithm implemented in this demo is known for its efficiency in determining the intersection points between rays and objects in a scene. By employing incremental calculations and avoiding unnecessary floating-point operations, the DDA algorithm significantly improves the performance of the raycasting process.
